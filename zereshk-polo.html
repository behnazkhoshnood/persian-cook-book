                <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large 12-inch skillet (with a lid) add the chicken thighs (bone side down), turmeric, salt,
                        pepper, onion halves and 3 cups of cold water. Without covering the skillet, bring it to a boil
                        over medium high so all the foam from cooking the raw chicken rises to the top. Use a slotted
                        spoon to skim off the foam. Reduce the heat to medium low, cover the skillet and cook for 30
                        minutes, then turn the chicken pieces and cook for another 30 minutes on medium low.</li>
                    <li>hirty minutes into cooking the chicken, start making the rice according to the instructions for
                        Aromatic rice.
                    </li>
                    <li>In a medium skillet fry the sliced medium onion in 2 tablespoons vegetable oil until golden
                        brown. Add the tomato paste and sauté until aromatic. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>When the chicken is fork tender, discard the onion halves. Turn the chicken pieces one more time
                        (now the meaty part of the chicken will be up) and sprinkle the optional ground saffron powder
                        on the pieces. Use the back of a spoon to rub the saffron on the surface of each piece. This
                        simple added step adds a very rich color to the chicken pieces.</li>
                    <li>Make the tomato sauce in the same skillet by mixing in the prepared fried onion and tomato paste
                        with the broth. Add 2 tablespoons fresh squeezed lemon juice and 1 tablespoon zereshk to the
                        sauce. Bring it to a boil over medium heat and then reduce the heat to medium low, cover the
                        skillet and cook for 15-20 minutes, then turn the chicken pieces and cook for another 15-20
                        minutes.</li>
                    <li>At the end of this cooking time the chicken should easily come apart with a fork. The sauce will
                        be reduced and a glistening oil will rise to the top, or as we say in Farsi, “ja biofteh” which
                        roughly means “to settle.” If there is too much sauce left in the skillet, remove the lid and
                        cook for a few more minutes until it is reduced.
                    </li>
                    <li>To make the zereshk/fried onion mix: In the same skillet that you've fried the diced onion, add
                        ⅓ cup barberries and a pinch of optional saffron and saute over low for couple of minutes until
                        the zereshk plumps up. Zereshk burns very quickly so keep the temperature very low.</li>
                    <li>For the layered presentation of Zereshk Polo: Use a large spatula to transfer ⅓ of the steamed
                        Aromatic rice to the serving platter, top with ⅓ of the barberry/fried onion mixture and
                        continue layering and finish the top with the remaining zereshk/fried onion. Garnish with sliced
                        almonds and/or pistachios.
                    </li>
                    <li>Serve the chicken on a separate platter.</li>
