                <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>At first, you need to wash and clean the lamb shank and let the extra water comes out. Then pick
                        a
                        suitable pot and grease it with oil. Put the pot on the flame and heat the oil. Then put the
                        half of
                        the
                        silvered chopped onions into the pot. Stir and fry the onions to have them soft and golden.
                        Place
                        the
                        Mahiche (lamb shanks) into the pot and fry them, remember to flip the shanks in order to have
                        both
                        sides
                        fried and cooked.</li>
                    <li>Now add the remaining half of the silvered onions and also the garlic, pepper, turmeric,
                        cinnamon
                        stick
                        and brewed saffron to the pot and stir the ingredients. Let the fragrance take over the house.
                        Put
                        the
                        lid of the pot on it and let it cook for about 3hours. The flame must be too low and it should
                        be
                        cooked
                        gradually. Be careful not to stir the shanks, because the onions might go beneath it and burn.
                    </li>
                    <li>After 3 hour, when the juice is too condensed add the salt to the lamb shanks. Flip the shanks
                        and
                        let
                        them cook for another 1 hour and half</li>
                    <li>Wash the rice with semi warm water and soak it for 2 hours with 2 teasp of salt.</li>
                    <li>Clean the broad beans and peel them. Then split them and wash again, let them soak for hours.
                        Then
                        cook
                        them in a pot with some water for about 5 minutes. Remove the foam of the surface with a spoon.
                        Rinse
                        the beans and put them aside.</li>
                    <li>Bring a pot full of water to the boil. Then add the rice to it and let it cook for 3 minutes.
                        Then
                        add
                        the cooked broad beans to the boiling water and rice, also add the fresh and finely chopped
                        dills to
                        the
                        content and stir them properly. When the rice is ready, rinse the content, wash the pot and let
                        it
                        dry.
                    </li>
                    <li>Then grease the pot and put it back on the flame. Cover the bottom surface of the pot with
                        desirable
                        tahdig making ingredients (you can place a layer of bread, carrots or lettuce).Put the rice
                        ingredients
                        in the pot and make it seem like a mountain, also make some holes in the rice mountain. Add some
                        oil
                        and
                        water to the rice and put the lid of the pot back on it. Remember to cover the lid by a napkin
                        (damkoni). Reduce the heat and let it steam for 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
                    <li>When the rice has steamed, mix a little bit of it by brewed saffron and serve the rice in a dish
                        while
                        garnishing it by the saffron rice. Remove the cinnamon stick from the Mahiche (shank) and serve
                        it
                        in
                        another dish. Your fabulous Baghali Polo Ba Mahiche in a very Persian traditional style is
                        ready!
